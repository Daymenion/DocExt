## New Model Release: Nanonets-OCR-s

**We're excited to announce the release of Nanonets-OCR-s, a compact 3B parameter model specifically trained for efficient image to markdown conversion with semantic understanding for images, signatures, watermarks, etc.!**

  📢 [Read the full announcement](https://nanonets.com/research/nanonets-ocr-s) | 🤗 [Hugging Face model](https://huggingface.co/nanonets/Nanonets-OCR-s)

## Overview

docext is a comprehensive on-premises document intelligence toolkit powered by vision-language models (VLMs). It provides three core capabilities:

**📄 PDF & Image to Markdown Conversion**: Transform documents into structured markdown with intelligent content recognition, including LaTeX equations, signatures, watermarks, tables, and semantic tagging.

**🔍 Document Information Extraction**: OCR-free extraction of structured information (fields, tables, etc.) from documents such as invoices, passports, and other document types, with confidence scoring.

**📊 Intelligent Document Processing Leaderboard**: A comprehensive benchmarking platform that tracks and evaluates vision-language model performance across OCR, Key Information Extraction (KIE), document classification, table extraction, and other intelligent document processing tasks.


## Features
### PDF and Image to Markdown
Convert both PDF and images to markdown with content recognition and semantic tagging.
- **LaTeX Equation Recognition**: Convert both inline and block LaTeX equations in images to markdown.
- **Intelligent Image Description**: Generate a detailed description for all images in the document within `<img></img>` tags.
- **Signature Detection**: Detect and mark signatures and watermarks in the document. Signatures text are extracted within `<signature></signature>` tags.
- **Watermark Detection**: Detect and mark watermarks in the document. Watermarks text are extracted within `<watermark></watermark>` tags.
- **Page Number Detection**: Detect and mark page numbers in the document. Page numbers are extracted within `<page_number></page_number>` tags.
- **Checkboxes and Radio Buttons**: Converts form checkboxes and radio buttons into standardized Unicode symbols (☐, ☑, ☒).
- **Table Detection**: Convert complex tables into html tables.

🔍 For in-depth information, see the [release blog](https://nanonets.com/research/nanonets-ocr-s/).

### Intelligent Document Processing Leaderboard
This benchmark evaluates performance across seven key document intelligence challenges:

- **Key Information Extraction (KIE)**: Extract structured fields from unstructured document text.
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Assess understanding of document content via question-answering.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Measure accuracy in recognizing printed and handwritten text.
- **Document Classification**: Evaluate how accurately models categorize various document types.
- **Long Document Processing**: Test models' reasoning over lengthy, context-rich documents.
- **Table Extraction**: Benchmark structured data extraction from complex tabular formats.
- **Confidence Score Calibration**: Evaluate the reliability and confidence of model predictions.

🔍 For in-depth information, see the [release blog](https://idp-leaderboard.org/details/).
